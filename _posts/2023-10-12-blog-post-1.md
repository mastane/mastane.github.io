In this blog post, we introduce a generalized notion of convexity for functions, that we call ["cross-convexity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15298) since it involves additional interaction terms compared to [standard convexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function).

<u>Definition:</u> A function $F:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said cross-convex if there exists $S\ge 1$ [log-concave functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmically_concave_function) $p_1,\dots,p_S$ such that
$$
\forall x\in \mathbb{R}^d , \   F(x) = -\log\left( \sum_{s=1}^S p_s(x) \right) .
$$

If $S=1$, then a cross-convex function is simply convex.
In the general case $S\ge 1$, we argue that this family of functions is still a natural one to consider as it includes the negative log-likelihood of the Gaussian mixture model.

Let us first recall that a differentiable function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is convex if it dominates all its tangent hyperplanes:
$$
\forall a, \forall x, f(x) \ge f(a) + \nabla f(a)^\top (x-a).
$$

$\bullet$ <u>Summation/Affine Closure:</u> A very important characteristic of the family of convex functions is that it is closed under (i) summation and (ii) affine reparametrization.
Formally, (i) if $f_1,f_2$ are two convex functions, then $f_1+f_2$ is also convex ; and (ii) if $f$ is convex, then $z \mapsto f(Az+b)$ is also convex.
These two closure properties are very important in machine learning where the objective function is typically equal to a sum over the dataset with affine neuronal transformations of the input data.
A first challenge when trying to generalize convexity for ML applications is to pick a family of functions satisfying such closedness under summation and affine reparametrization.
For instance, while the notion of [quasi-convexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiconvex_function) is often cited as a natural extension of standard convexity, unfortunately it is not closed under summation since the sum of two quasi-convex functions is not necessarily quasi-convex.

<u>Proposition:</u> Let $F = -\log\left( \sum_{s=1}^S p_s \right)$ and $\tilde F = -\log\left( \sum_{s=1}^{\tilde S} \tilde p_s \right)$ be two cross-convex functions with $S,\tilde S \ge 1$ and $p_s,\tilde p_s : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow (0,+\infty)$ log-concave functions.
Then, the sum $F+\tilde F$ is also cross-convex. Indeed,
$$
F+\tilde F = -\log\left( \sum_{s=1}^S \sum_{s'=1}^{\tilde S} p_s \tilde p_{s'} \right) ,
$$
where the product of two log-concave functions $p_s \tilde p_s$ is also log-concave.

Moreover, the class of cross-convex functions is also closed under affine reparametrization (follows from the closedness of log-concave functions).

$\bullet$ Note that the right-hand side in the convexity inequality, namely "$f(a) + \nabla f(a)^\top (x-a)$", represents the tangent hyperplane of $f$ at the point $a$.
In particular, this lower bound is a critical ingredient in the analysis of gradient descent (see e.g. [Bach's LTFP book](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf)).
In the following, we explain step-by-step how to obtain a similar lower bound in the cross convex case.
For simplicity, we focus on the very specific case $S=2$ and $p_1=p_2=p$, which already unveils phenomena unseen in the convex case. We refer the reader to Lemma 1 in ["Beyond Log-Concavity: Theory and Algorithm for Sum-Log-Concave Optimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15298) for the more general statement.

### Steps
* Given log-concave function $p$
* Compute cross-convex function $F(x,y)=-\log(p(x)+p(y))$
* Tangent lower bound $\mathcal{T}_{a,b}(x, y) \le F(x,y)$ at point $(a,b)$:
$$\mathcal{T}_{a,b}(x, y) = F(a,b) + \nabla F(a,b)^\top \begin{pmatrix} x-a \\ y-b \end{pmatrix} - D_{\text{KL}}\left( \begin{pmatrix} \frac{p(a)}{p(a)+p(b)} \\ \frac{p(b)}{p(a)+p(b)} \end{pmatrix} \, \Bigg \| \, \begin{pmatrix} \frac{p(x)}{p(x)+p(y)} \\ \frac{p(y)}{p(x)+p(y)} \end{pmatrix} \right)$$
* <u>Note:</u> _Actually, the negative sign in front of the KL is bad news for the analysis of gradient descent...check out my paper to see how to solve that issue, by considering a reweighted version of the gradient_
