Abstract. We present a generalization of the proximal operator defined through a convex combination of convex objectives, where the coefficients are updated in a minimax fashion. We prove that this new operator is Bregman firmly nonexpansive with respect to a Bregman divergence that combines Euclidean and information geometries.
